# Introduction

I have worked 2 years for Minerva Rockets, an aerospace research group within my University, UFRJ (Federal University of Rio de Janeiro). During these years, I was responsible for the avionics, the electronics that go inside the rocket and act as its brain. I worked developing both hardware and software.

# Hardware

The hardware that went inside the rocket consisted of multiple PCBs (Printed Circuit Boards) stacked on top of each other. I drawed the circuits, create the footprints and assembled the PCBs within Altium. Some of the components that I needed for my PCB did not have any 3D model available, so I also created those in SolidWorks and made available for other people (currently there's more than 3000 downloads). They can be checked in my GrabCad profile: https://grabcad.com/gabriel.aleksandravicius-1

The system consisted of the following boards:
- Command and Data Handling System (CDHS)
- Electrical Power System (EPS)
- Recovery (REC)
- COTS/A
- COTS/B

The following sections contain the schematics and the PCB model for each board. The PCBs were made in two versions: one called 'prototyped' and one called 'final'. The prototyped one was made because my team had access to a CNC machine, however it had some technical constraints and thus the boards needed to be 85x85 instead of 100x100. The 'final' boards were the ones that were used inside the rocket.

Before checking each board individually, see below how the system looked after being finished.
